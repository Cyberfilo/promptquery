"""Hand-authored eval questions for the `shop` fixture.

Each Question carries:
- text: the natural-language question (what the user types)
- must_retrieve: tables the retriever MUST surface to have any chance of
  producing correct SQL. Used to score retrieval recall.
- nice_to_retrieve: tables that are useful but not strictly required.
  Not counted against recall, but tracked for precision diagnostics.
- reference_sql: a correct SQL answer (used by the future end-to-end eval).
- difficulty: easy / medium / hard — calibrated by hand.
- tags: free-form categorization for failure-mode analysis.
